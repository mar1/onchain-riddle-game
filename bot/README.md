# Bot

A simple watcher that listens for winners and posts new riddles automatically.

Fully generated by Claude Code in one prompt.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your `.env`:

```bash
BOT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...        # Must be the wallet that deployed the contract
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://...  # Use Alchemy or Infura, public RPCs can be flaky
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...       # Your deployed contract address
```

To add or change riddles, edit the `riddles` array in `index.js`.

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

The bot will print a message when it starts, then sit and wait for Winner events.

## What it does

1. Connects to Sepolia and watches the contract for `Winner` events
2. When someone solves the riddle, it picks the next one from its list
3. Hashes the answer with keccak256 (same as the contract does for verification)
4. Sends a transaction to call `setRiddle()`

The riddles are hardcoded in `index.js`
